Lots Of Branches to play with

## `main`

The main branch to which other branches might merge to.

## `bugFix`

A branch that supposedly fixes a bug. Notice that, except for the commit
messages, there is no good way of telling which parent of the merge commit comes
form the `main` branch, and which side comes from the `bugFix` branch.`
